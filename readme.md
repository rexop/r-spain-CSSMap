## Code to create a CSS map on /r/Spain subreddit

This was heavily based on code I referenced from [r/Europe](https://www.reddit.com/r/Europe/), but with custom map markers for Spanish Autonomous Regions and better Safari support.

Safari was reacting badly to styles applied to `html` and `body` elements, so I applied them to the first child paragraph.
